For this project I used the following sites:

stackoverflow.com
knockoutjs.com/documentation
jquery.com

How to run this app:
1. click index.html file with a modern browser
2. in screen you should see about 5-6 location markers on the map and a list of all those locations on the left side of the screen
3. click a marker to see the street view of the location
4. in search bar you can search for one of the locations from the list and it will show only that location on the map and list
5. after search you should refresh the page to see all markers again


Steps of development:
Took the courses on apis on udacity site
Did some more reading and research on knockoutjs by going through many online tutorials
started with a list of locations of salons in Metuchen NJ
Used google Map API to show the map with those locations
Used the lat and lang of those locations to create google map markers for each of those
Used the lat and lang to use google Street View API to get the image for each of the locations
used those images in my map infowindow with the name of locations
